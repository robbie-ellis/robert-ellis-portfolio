    <p>The CIS 241, <strong>Web Development 1</strong> course, offered through Edmonds 
	College has been challenging, fun, and enlightening.  Prior to this course, 
	although I had taken the intro to programming course utilizing Python and the Java 
	1 course, I had never done any work directly with HTML or CSS.  I had created a 
	site using drag and drop tools, but I really enjoy and value getting to know how 
	the code underneath actually works, and this website is the result of my current 
	understanding and abilities.
	</p>
	<p>
	I’ve found that the most important parts of this course have been getting 
	familiar with the terminology related to HTML and CSS, and getting an idea of 
	what they can do on their own, as well as how they work together.  Without 
	understanding fundamental terms, like what HTML elements and attributes are, it’s 
	difficult to even formulate questions about it.  Now that I understand a 
	significant portion of the terminology and components of HTML and CSS, I know what 
	to ask and what to look for when I run into a problem, or when I have something 
	specific that I want to create in my design.
	</p>
	<p>
	I love getting opportunities to create something with all the coding I’ve been 
	studying, and I’ve really enjoyed putting this site together.  Working with HTML 
	and CSS has also made me realize how excited I am to proceed on to <strong>Web 
	Development 2</strong>, where I’ll focus on JavaScript, giving me the abilities to make 
	sites much more interactive.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Designing this site has been a wonderful experience.  I can’t wait to add some 
	JavaScript to it next quarter!
